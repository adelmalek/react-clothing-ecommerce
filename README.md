# Complete React Developer ZTM Course


- E-commerce app with Redux, Hooks, Stripe, Firebase


- Styles:
    - Sass (CSS pre-processor)
    - styled-components (React-specific CSS-in-JS styling solution)


- React Hooks:
    - useState (state variables)
    - useEffect (to perform side effects: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers)
    - useContext (pass data or state through the component tree)
    - useReducer (similar to useState, e.g. an object containing keys that we want to update independently)
  

- React Router
    - Routes, Route


- Redux
    - Redux is simply a store to store the state of the variables in your app. Redux creates a process and procedures to interact with the store so that components will not just update or read the store randomly.
    - Persist (even after refreshing the browser, the site state will still be preserved)
    - Logger (logging actions and state makes it easy to understand bugs and user-reported issues)
    - Thunk (middleware, allows to dispatch actions manually)
    - Saga (it has access to the full redux application state and it can dispatch redux actions as well)


- Firebase
    - Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service.
    - Firebase is categorized as a NoSQL database program, which stores data in JSON-like documents.
    - (Firebase Authentication - It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more.)


- Netlify
    - A platform that offers cloud hosting and serverless backend services for static websites.


- Stripe
    - Global technology company that builds and provides financial infrastructure.
    - Receiving and managing various payment transactions.
    - Allows to pay with credit cards and digital wallets (MasterCard, VISA, American Express, Apple Pay,Google Pay)


- TypeScript
  - TypeScript is an object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft Corporation, whereas JavaScript is the programming language for the web.
  - TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.


- PWA
  - Progressive web apps are much simpler to develop and use than other web or native solutions. For instance, since they can be installed from the browser, there is no need to submit them to the App Store or Google Play.
  - Theyâ€™re compatible with all devices on all operating systems if accessed through a standards-compliant browser.
  - If the network connection is unstable or absent, PWAs use cached data from previous sessions to ensure perfect and uninterrupted performance. The users will be able to access your app from basically anywhere.
  - Similar to a native mobile app, a user can open the PWA by clicking the icon on the home screen.
